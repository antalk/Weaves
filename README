-- Building --

Use maven as such: mvn clean install , it will then build and test the library and place it in your local repository. From there you can create a dependency in your own Tapestry project and Weaves will be auto-loaded by Tapestry.

-- Testing --

Currently at around 70% coverage. Still some work to do to increase coverage.

-- DEMO --

A working demo can be found at: http://intercommitweavesdemo.intercommit.cloudbees.net/
There are 3 parts still not (correctly) working at the demo site: 

TextMarker demo - Crashes with a internal Tapestry exception
ModalBox demo - Crashes with a internal Tapestry exception
Hibernate demo - Seems to ignore the Layout component
